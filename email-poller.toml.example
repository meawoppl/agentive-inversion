# Email Poller Configuration
#
# This service polls Gmail accounts for new emails using OAuth.
# Each account needs its own OAuth credentials and token cache file.

# Directory where downloaded emails are stored
inbox_dir = "./emails/inbox"

# Directory where emails to be archived are placed (by another service)
archive_queue_dir = "./emails/to_archive"

# How often to poll for new emails (seconds)
poll_interval_secs = 300

# How often to check the archive queue (seconds)
archive_check_interval_secs = 30

# Global rate limit: minimum seconds between polls for any account
rate_limit_secs = 60

# Global max fetch: maximum emails to fetch per poll
max_fetch_per_poll = 50

# Gmail accounts to poll
# Each account uses InstalledFlow OAuth (desktop app style).
# On first run, the service will open a browser for authentication.
#
# To set up:
# 1. Create OAuth credentials at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
# 2. Download the credentials JSON file
# 3. Add an account entry below with the path to the credentials file

[[accounts]]
name = "Personal"
email = "your.email@gmail.com"
credentials_path = "gmail_credentials.json"
token_cache_path = "gmail_token_personal.json"

# [[accounts]]
# name = "Work"
# email = "your.work@company.com"
# credentials_path = "gmail_credentials_work.json"
# token_cache_path = "gmail_token_work.json"

# Optional: Calendar integration for adding detected events
# [calendar]
# credentials_path = "calendar_credentials.json"
# token_cache_path = "calendar_token_cache.json"
# calendar_name = "AI - Events"
